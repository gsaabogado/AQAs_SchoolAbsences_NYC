It is divided into five sub-sections\n\n::: {.incremental}\n- Data on School Absences\n- Data on the forecast of the air quality index\n- Data on the air quality index\n- Demographic covariates\n- Weather data\n:::\n\n2. ***Descriptive Statistics*** contains descriptive statistics on school absences and the forecasts of the air quality index in New York City. It is divided into two subsections; **School Absences and Demographics** and **Descriptives on the AQI Forecast**.\n\n3. ***Methodology*** includes a rough description of the methodology I use to estimate the effect of NYC air quality health advisories on school absences. It is divided into two main sections; **Regression Discontinuity** and **Synthetic DiD**.\n\n4. ***Results*** presents and discusses the main results of the research project. \n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nConsider that all sections contain the R-code necessary to replicate the figures, tables, and overall results of the study. Regarding the construction of the data-sets, we share the link to the dropbox repository alongside instructions to load the raw data files and transform them into the pannel data we use to estimate the effect with regression discontinuity and difference-in-difference designs.\n:::\n\n# Replication\n\nAll the raw files needed to run the code are in the [dropbox repository](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1jyjs84sef7t1nt/AABtbantKPm4OyICNEIklpXLa?dl=0)\n\nIf you want to replicate the study:\n\nDownload all files in the [dropbox repository](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1jyjs84sef7t1nt/AABtbantKPm4OyICNEIklpXLa?dl=0) while considering the space constraints in your computer.[^1] The files in the repository have a folder-like structure with the following key sections:\n\n[^1]: I recommend downloading the files to an external hard drive to avoid memory issues\n\n1.  **01_RawData** -- Includes the raw data files obtained from the New York State Department of Education, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, The Environmental Protection Agency, and the Census Buro.\n\n2.  **02_GenData** -- Contains the data files I use for the analysis.\n\n3.  **03_scripts** -- Here, I include all the R-scripts I use to transform the raw data into a useful format, perform descriptive statistics, and run my empirical specifications\n\n4.  **AQAs_School_Absences_NYC** -- This folder contains the Quarto files necessary to replicate this website\n\n# Raw data files\n\nAs previously mentioned, the folder 01_RawData folder contains all the raw files I obtained to estimate the effect of air quality health advisories on school absences.\n\n01_schools includes all files related to school absences and school characteristics in New York City. 02_AQI has the data on the air quality index forecast from the NYSDEC and the AQI measures from the EPA. 03_weather contains several data files of weather covariates. 04_shp is a repository of shape (or spatial) files. And 05_dem includes data on neighborhood-level socio-demographic characteristics from the US Census Buro.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.36","theme":"-custom.scss","title":"About","description":"This website contains all the data and R-code necessary to replicate the results of the study: Air Quality Alerts and School Absences: Evidence from New York City.\n","author":"Luis Sarmiento"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
