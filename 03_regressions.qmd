  footnote(general = "Effects of air quality health advisories on school absences in New York City. Point estimates come from a regression discontinuity design. The score is equal to the distance between the forecasted air quality index and 101 units (the threshold for the emission of health advisories). The dependent variable is the log value of school absences at the neighborhood level. Interpret point estimates as the percentage increase in absences because of the advisory, e.g., an coefficient of two is equivalent to a two percent increase in absences. Cluster robsut standard errors in parenthesis. Significance Codes: ***: 0.01, **: 0.05, *: 0.1", general_title = "Notes:", footnote_as_chunk = T)
