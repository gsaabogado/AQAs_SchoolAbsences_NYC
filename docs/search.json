The issue date is the date the NYSDEC estimated the forecast, and the forecast period is the difference between the issue and forecast dates. It can take five different values; Next Day, 2 Day, Same Day, 3 Day, 4 Day, 5 Day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is relevant to distinguish between the issue and forecast dates. The issue date is the date that the NYSDEC performs the forecast. the forecast date is the date of the forecast. For instance, the NYSDEC can forecast an AQI value of 105 for May 1st on April 29th. In this example, April 29th is the issue date, and May 1st is the forecast date. It is worth noting that forecasts can have different issue dates. For instance, there can be three forecasts for January 1st.\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Show the data set\nkbl(head(RawAqi, 2)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\")) |> \n  column_spec(c(1), italic = T, color = \"DarkBlue\") %>% \n   footnote(general = \"IssueDate is the date of issue of the forecast, ForecastDate is the forecasted date.

The ultimate goal is to assign a single AQI forecast to each date between 2008 and 2018.\nIn Table 6, I essentially keep the same structure of Table 5 with the slight difference that I change the forecast period by a numeric variable equivalent to the difference between the issue and forecast dates.\nNext, in Table 7, I construct a series of dummy and categorical variables to understand the nature of each forecast. The column SingleForecast indicates situations when only one issued forecast for that particular date exists. For example, if there were two forecasts for January 1st, one on December 30th and the other on the 31st, the value of this column would be equal to zero. The ForecastType is a categorical variable that indicates the structure of issued forecasts for that particular date, e.g., Forecast (0, -2) means that there was a forecast issued at \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t = -2\\). The SameDay variable is equal to one if the issue and forecast dates occur on the same day. The same logic holds for NextDay, TwoDays, ThreeDays, and FourDays. For instance, a value of 1 in the FourDays column occurs when the issue date is four days before the forecast.\n\nRaw VariablesIndicators on the type of forecastIndicators on the type of alert\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Show the data set\nkbl(head(select(Full, IssueDate:aqi), 2)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = T, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\")) |> \n  column_spec(c(1), italic = T, color = \"DarkBlue\") %>% \n   footnote(general = \"IssueDate is the date of issue of the forecast Forecast date is the date t.of the alert.

The EPA and local environmental authorities emit AQAs when the value of the AQI is higher than one hundred units. With this in mind, the alert column is an indicator variable equal to one if the AQI forecast exceeds one hundred. The FullAlert column is also one when all forecasts on that date predict an AQA. SingleAlert is one if only one forecast is higher than one hundred units. OnlySameDayAlert is equal to one when there is only one same-day forecast, and NextAndSameDayAlert is equal to one if there were two issues for the same forecast – one on the date of the forecast and the other one day before.\nFigure 1 and Figure 2 show the share of observations with specific combinations of issued forecasts. For the full sample 93% of forecasts were issued at \\(t \\in (0, -1)\\), \\(\\$t \\in (0, -3)\\), \\(t \\in (-1)\\), and \\(t \\in (-2)\\). For the sub-sample of days with an air quality alert, 89% of the forecast are issued at \\(t \\in (0, -1)\\), $t (0, -1, -2, -3) $, $t (-1) $, and \\(t \\in (0, -3)\\).\n\nFull SampleAlerts\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Create the plot data\nplot = Full %>% group_by(ForecastType) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(share = (count/sum(count))*100)\n# Ggplot\nggplot(plot) + geom_bar(aes(y = reorder(ForecastType, -share), x = share), stat = \"identity\", fill = \"DarkBlue\") + theme_economist()  %+replace% \n  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) + \n  labs(x = \"Percentage share of observations\", y = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Forecast type across the full sample of forecasted AQIs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Create the plot data\nplot = Full %>% filter(alert == 1) %>% group_by(ForecastType) %>% \n  summarise(count = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(share = (count/sum(count))*100)\n# Ggplot\nggplot(plot) + geom_bar(aes(y = reorder(ForecastType, -share), x = share), stat = \"identity\", fill = \"DarkBlue\") + theme_economist()  %+replace% \n  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) + \n  labs(x = \"Percentage share of observations\", y = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Forecast type for the dates with an AQA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis combination of different forecasts raises one clear issue; if we want to assign one single value per date, which one should we choose? For this, use the following algorithm:\n\n\nFor the days without an alert, we select the AQI forecast closest to \\(t\\). For instance, if the AQI value for January 1st has one forecast on December 31st and another on December 30th, we select the 31st as the value of the forecasted AQI.\nFor days when there is an alert, and all forecasts imply an AQI value higher than 100 units, we choose the forecast closest to \\(t\\)\nWhen there is a discrepancy between two forecasts regarding the existence of an AQA, we choose the highest. For instance, the forecast at \\(t = 0\\) implies an AQI value of 93 and the one at \\(t = 1\\) a value of 101. In this situation, we will assign the value of 101.\n\n\nI use this algorithm to reach a final data set of forested AQI values. Table 9 shows the first rows of this final data file. In it date is the date of the forecast. ForecastType is the type of forecast as previously defined. pm25, o3, and aqi are the forecasted values of fine particulate matter, ozone, and the air quality index. *** alert *** is an indicator variable equal to one when the AQI is larger than 100. Moreover, I include a set of indicator variables on the structure of the forecast, i.e., was it a single alert? Did all the forecasts point to the emission of an alert?

Furthermore, the probability of forecasts higher than 100 units is also higher during the summer. For instance, out of 131 alerts, one hundred and five occurred during the summer, fourteen in the spring, eight in Autumn, and only four throughout the winter.\n\nTime SeriesMonthly VarYearly VarWeekday varDensity distribution\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Construct the data for the plot \n# Create the data for the plot\nplot = filter(aqif, date < \"2018-12-31\") |>  \n  mutate(season = hydroTSM::time2season(date, out.fmt = \"seasons\")) |> \n  mutate(season = str_to_title(season)) \n\n\n\nggplot(plot) + geom_bar(aes(x = date, y =aqi, fill = season), stat = \"identity\", alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 100), color = \"red\") + labs(y = \"Air Quality Index (Forecast)\", x = \"\") +\n  theme_economist() %+replace% \n  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_text(vjust = 2, angle = 90)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Spring\" = \"#F97A1F\", \"Summer\" = \"#C91D42\", \n                               \"Winter\" = \"#475ED1\", \"Autumn\"  = \"#B3B3B3\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Mean daily value of the AQI forecast between 2008 and 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Construct the data for the plot \nplot = filter(aqif, date < \"2018-12-31\") |>  \n  mutate(year = year(date), month = month(date, label = T), weekday = weekdays(date, abbreviate = T)) |> \n  group_by(frame = month) %>% summarise(aqi = mean(aqi, na.rm = T))\n\n\n# Plot the time series \nggplot(plot) + geom_line(aes(y = aqi, x = frame, group = 1)) + \n  geom_point(aes(y = aqi, x = frame, group = 1), color = \"red\") + \n  theme_economist()%+replace% \n  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_text(vjust = 2, angle = 90)) + \n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Average AQI forecast\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Mean monthly value of the AQI forecast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Create the data for the plot\nplot = filter(aqif, date < \"2018-12-31\") |>  \n  mutate(year = year(date), month = month(date, label = T), weekday = weekdays(date, abbreviate = T)) |> \n  group_by(frame = year) %>% summarise(aqi = mean(aqi, na.rm = T)) |> mutate(frame = as_factor(frame))\n\n# Plot the time series \nggplot(plot) + geom_segment(aes(y = aqi, x = frame, xend = frame, yend = 45, group = 1), lwd = 3) + \n  geom_point(aes(y = aqi, x = frame, group = 1), color = \"red\", size = 4) + \n  theme_economist()%+replace% \n  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_text(vjust = 2, angle = 90)) +\n  labs(y = \"Avg.

As expected, predicted values are significantly higher during the summer months of June to August and the Winter Months of December to January. Higher summer values are in line with higher ozone formation during the hotter months of the year because of the interaction of solar radiations with ozone precursors. Higher winter measures relate to the lower efficiency of internal combustion engines at cold temperatures and the use of fossil fuels for residential heating.\nNext, Figure 16 and Figure 17 contain the average yearly and weekday values of the AQI forecast. Even though the AQI value seems higher between 2008 and 2011 and lower after that, it is not straightforward to notice any long-term trend. Regarding weekday variation, there are slightly higher average values at the start of the week (Monday to Wednesday) and lower from Thursday to Sunday.\nFinally, Figure 18 contains the density function of the AQI forecast. The forecasts appear normally distributed between zero and slightly before one hundred units. However, as we approach one hundred units, there is some clear bunching around the alert threshold, suggesting that the model used by the NYSDEC may work slightly differently when the forecast is in the neighborhood of the alert. In the empirical strategy, we exploit this bunching to identify the effects of the alert on school absences.\nThe following figures compare the forecasted and real AQIs. ?@fig-AqiDifferenceTs contains the time series of average mean daily differences between the predicted and actual AQIs. There appear to be relevant differences between both time series, with a maximum difference of 56 and a minimum of -92 AQI units. These differences aggregate to an average difference between both variables of -3.9 with a standard deviation of 15.17 units. Figure 19 further includes the density plot of the difference between the real and forecasted AQIs.\n\nDaily DifferencesDensity of Daily Diff.Monthly DifferencesYearly DifferencesWeekday

AQI values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, in Figure 20, I portray the average monthly value of the AQI measure and its forecasts. It is interesting to see that the difference between the accurate measure and the forecast of the AQI is lower during the summer months of June to August and higher at the start of the year between January and April. Figure 21 portrays a similar picture with yearly average differences. Notably, the ability of the NYSDEC to predict the AQI increased between 2008 and 2017. With a mean difference in 2008 of close to four units and for 2018 of less than 0.5. In figure Figure 22, we add differences by day of the week where, although the value of the objective AQI measure is consistently higher than its forecast, I cannot distinguish any pattern in the average weekday difference of both time series. Finally, Figure 23 contains the density distributions of the real and forecasted AQIs. Two things stand out. First, the AQI forecast has more density around its median and a smaller tail; second, there is a clear difference in the bunching of the AQI around 100 units."
