Table 1 shows the structure of the data. There are 3,339,158 observations in the panel with 1,854 unique school identifiers. The data set spans between Jan 2006 and Dec 2018. It contains the school’s id, the observation date, and the total number of enrolled, present, absent, and released students. It also includes a categorical variable indicating if an abnormal event affected school absences on that date, e.g., extreme weather events like blizzards or hurricanes. I further obtain data on the location of each school. Table 2 contains the school’s type, id, longitude, latitude, tract, neighbourhood, and borough. Table 3 presents socio-demographic data obtained from the New York State Department of Education (NYSDE). The table contains the school’s id, year of observation, count of enrolled students, and the share of female, male, Asian, Hispanic, Black, and White students. Other variables include the share of students with disabilities, learning English, qualifying for free or reduced price lunch, being eligible for human resources administration benefits (poverty), or facing economic hardship (eni). Finally, Table Table 4 contains the school id, the year of observation (only available from 2014), the share of students passing the English Language Art (ELA) and Mathematics (math) tests, and the percentage of fourth-year and sixth-year graduates.\n\nAbsencesLocationDemographicsProficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Structure of the raw file on school absences in NYC \n \n  \n    id \n    date \n    SchoolYear \n    enrolled \n    present \n    absent \n    released \n    DayType \n  \n \n\n  \n    01M015 \n    2006-09-05 \n    2006-2007 \n    252 \n    226 \n    26 \n    0 \n    NormalDay \n  \n  \n    01M015 \n    2006-09-06 \n    2006-2007 \n    248 \n    227 \n    21 \n    0 \n    NormalDay \n  \n  \n    01M015 \n    2006-09-07 \n    2006-2007 \n    245 \n    228 \n    17 \n    0 \n    NormalDay \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2:  Data on the spatial location of schools in NYC \n \n  \n    id \n    lon \n    lat \n    tract \n    nta \n    ntacode \n    boro \n    SchoolType \n  \n \n\n  \n    01M015 \n    -73.97875 \n    40.72207 \n    002601 \n    Lower East Side \n    MN28 \n    Manhattan \n    Elementary \n  \n  \n    01M019 \n    -73.98450 \n    40.73001 \n    004000 \n    East Village \n    MN22 \n    Manhattan \n    Elementary \n  \n  \n    01M020 \n    -73.98631 \n    40.72131 \n    003001 \n    Chinatown \n    MN27 \n    Manhattan \n    Elementary \n  \n\n\nNotes:   lon = Longitude, lat = Latitude, tract = US Census Tract, nta = neighborhood, boro = borough, SchholType = type of school\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Show the data set\nkbl(head(dem, 3)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\")) |> \n  column_spec(c(1), italic = T, color = \"DarkBlue\") %>% \n   footnote(general = \"id refers to School ID and students to the count of enrolled students in that school and year combinations.

It includes the issue date, forecast date, emission lag, and forecasted value of ozone (o3), fine particulate matter (pm25), and the air quality index (AQI). The issue date is the date the NYSDEC estimated the forecast, and the emission lag is the difference between the issue and forecast dates.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5:  Raw data on the Air Quality Index \n \n  \n    IssueDate \n    ForecastDate \n    EmissionLag \n    o3 \n    pm25 \n    aqi \n  \n \n\n  \n    2007-12-31 \n    2008-01-01 \n    -1 \n    NA \n    65 \n    65 \n  \n  \n    2007-12-31 \n    2008-01-02 \n    -2 \n    NA \n    40 \n    40 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is relevant to distinguish between the issue and forecast dates. The issue date is the date that the NYSDEC performs the forecast. the forecast date is the date of the forecast. For instance, the NYSDEC can forecast an AQI value of 105 for May 1st on April 29th. In this example, April 29th is the issue date, and May 1st the forecast date. It is worth noting that forecasts can have different issue dates. For instance, there can be three forecasts for January 1st.\nTable 6 contains a series of dummy and categorical variables to understand the nature of each forecast. The column SingleForecast indicates situations when only one issued forecast for that particular date exists. For example, if there were two forecasts for January 1st, one on December 30th and the other on the 31st, the value of this column would be zero. The ForecastType is a categorical variable that indicates the structure of issued forecasts for that particular date, e.g., Forecast (0, -2) means that there was a forecast issued at \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t = -2\\). The SameDay variable is equal to one if the issue and forecast dates occur on the same day. The same logic holds for NextDay, TwoDays, ThreeDays, and FourDays. For instance, a value of 1 in the FourDays column occurs when the issue date is four days before the forecast.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6:  Raw data on the Air Quality Index (Forecast Indicators) \n \n  \n    IssueDate \n    ForecastDate \n    aqi \n    SingleForecast \n    ForecastType \n    SameDay \n    NextDay \n    TwoDays \n    ThreeDays \n    FourDays \n  \n \n\n  \n    2007-12-31 \n    2008-01-01 \n    65 \n    1 \n    Forecast (-1) \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    2007-12-31 \n    2008-01-02 \n    40 \n    0 \n    Forecast (0,-2) \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7 includes a set of variables on the emission of an air quality alert (AQA). The alert column is an indicator variable equal to one if the AQI forecast exceeds one hundred units. The FullAlert column is one when all forecasts on that date predict an alert. SingleAlert is one if only one forecast is higher than one hundred units. OnlySameDayAlert is one when there is only one same-day forecast. And NextAndSameDayAlert is equal to one if there were two issues for the same forecast – one on the date of the forecast and the other one day before.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7:  Raw data on the Air Quality Index (Alert Indicators) \n \n  \n    IssueDate \n    ForecastDate \n    aqi \n    alert \n    FullAlert \n    SingleAlert \n    OnlySameDayAlert \n    NextAndSameDayAlert \n    TwoDaysSingleAlert \n  \n \n\n  \n    2007-12-31 \n    2008-01-01 \n    65 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    2007-12-31 \n    2008-01-02 \n    40 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 and Figure 2 show the share of observations with specific combinations of issued forecasts. For the full sample 63% of forecasts were issued one day before and at the date of the alert. For the sub-sample of days with an air quality alert, this number increases to 67%. This combination of different forecasts raises one clear issue; if we want to assign one single value per date, which one of the forecasts should we choose? For this, use the following algorithm:\n\n\nFor the days without an alert, we select the AQI forecast closest to \\(t\\). For instance, if the AQI value for January 1st has one forecast on December 31st and another on December 30th, we select the 31st as the value of the forecasted AQI.\nFor days when there is an alert, and all forecasts imply an AQI value higher than 100 units, we choose the forecast closest to \\(t\\)\nWhen there is a discrepancy between two forecasts regarding the existence of an AQA, we choose the highest. For instance, the forecast at \\(t = 0\\) implies an AQI value of 93 and the one at \\(t = 1\\) a value of 101. In this situation, we will assign the value of 101.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Forecast type across the full sample of forecasted AQIs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Forecast type for the dates with an AQA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8 shows the first rows of the final data set on the AQU forecast. In it date is the date of the forecast. ForecastType is the type of forecast as previously defined. pm25, o3, and aqi are the forecasted values of fine particulate matter, ozone, and the air quality index. alert is an indicator variable equal to one when the AQI is larger than 100. I also include a set of indicator variables on the structure of the forecast, i.e., was it a single alert? Did all the forecasts point to the emission of an alert?\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Show the data set\nkbl(head(filter(AqiForecast, alert == 1), 3)) %>% \n  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = \"Cambria\") %>% \n  kable_styling(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\")) |> \n  column_spec(c(1), italic = T, color = \"DarkBlue\") \n\n\n\n\nTable 8:  Final data set on the forecast of the AQI \n \n  \n    date \n    ForecastType \n    pm25 \n    o3 \n    aqi \n    alert \n    SingleAlert \n    FullAlert \n    OnlySameDayAlert \n    NextAndSameDayAlert \n    TwoDaysSingleAlert \n  \n \n\n  \n    2008-06-07 \n    Forecast (-1) \n    92 \n    114 \n    114 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    2008-06-08 \n    Forecast (-2) \n    80 \n    101 \n    101 \n    1 \n    1 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    2008-06-09 \n    Forecast (0,-3) \n    NA \n    105 \n    105 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Data on the air quality index\n\n\n\nI obtain AQI measurements from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pre-generated data files.

Schools spread around the city, with significant clusters in South Bronx, North Manhattan, and Brooklyn. Staten Island and Queen’s distance between schools is larger than for the Bronx or Manhattan. The data set contains 856 elementary schools, 495 high schools, 379 junior high schools, 267 kindergarten to eighth-grade schools (K8), 145 secondaries, 109 kindergarten to twelfth-grade schools (K12), 2 early childhood, and two ungraded. Figure 2 portrays the median neighborhood income in 2016 (according to the American Community Survey). The city’s wealthier areas are in Manhattan, Staten Island, and West Brooklyn, with more impoverished regions in South Bronx and East Brooklyn. Figure 3 portrays the share of white persons in each neighborhood. The strong correlation between income and the share of whites is evident, with higher percentages of white persons in Manhattan and Staten Island and lower shares in the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. Figure 4 contains the share of children’s hospitalization per 10,000 across all city areas. Again, there is a strong relationship between asthma hospitalizations and income, with higher hospitalization rates in the Bronx and North-Central Brooklyn and lower in Staten Island and Manhattan.\n\nSchools in NYCIncomeShare of whitesAsthma Hosp.

There are 3,339,158 observations across 1,854 schools. On average, there are 56 daily absences per school in the city of New York. This is equivalent to around 9.04% of enrolled students. The absences have a median of 39 and a standard deviation of 75. Concerning released students, 2 (0.40%) students are released from school on an average day. Additionally, and in line with an over-dispersed Poisson distribution, releases have a median of 0 and a standard deviation of 27 pupils per day.\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Show the data set\nsumtable(select(ungroup(absent), absent, released, enrolled), \n         digits = 2, fixed.digits = T, \n         summ = c(\"mean(x)\", \"median(x)\", \"sd(x)\", \"min(x)\", \n                  \"max(x)\", \"notNA(x)\",\"countNA(x)\"), \n         summ.names = c(\"Mean\", \"Median\", \"SD\", \"Min\", \"Max\", \"N\", \"NAs\"), \n         labels = c(\"Absent Students\", \"Released Students\", \"Enrolled Students\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Descriptive Statistics on School Absences \n \n  \n    Variable \n    Mean \n    Median \n    SD \n    Min \n    Max \n    N \n    NAs \n  \n \n\n  \n    Absent Students \n    56.34 \n    39 \n    74.74 \n    0 \n    3511 \n    3339158 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Released Students \n    2.46 \n    0 \n    27.29 \n    0 \n    3777 \n    3338834 \n    324 \n  \n  \n    Enrolled Students \n    622.96 \n    497 \n    511.04 \n    1 \n    5850 \n    3339158 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 shows the number of schools per year reporting absences. Between 2008 and 2018, the number of reporting schools moved from a minimum of 1,545 in 2008 to a maximum of 1,659 in 2016. There are 1,365 schools in the data set that reported absenteeism for all years between 2008 and 2018. Although I use the entire sample in the regression analysis, I provide evidence that our results are robust to only focusing on the set of schools that never drop the panel.\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Number of schools reporting absences per year\nabsent |>  filter(DayType == \"NormalDay\") |>  \n  group_by(year) |> summarise(Schools = length(unique(id))) |>  \n  filter(year > 2007) |> mutate(year = as_factor(year)) %>% ggplot() + \n   geom_line(aes(x = year, y= Schools, group = 1), size = 0.75) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = year, y= Schools), color = \"red\") +\n  labs(y = \"\", x = \"Year\") +   theme_economist() %+replace%\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), plot.background = element_blank()) +\n  grids(\"y\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Number of reporting schools\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 portrays the density function of school absences.

Each bar represents a day between 2006 and 2018. The breaks in the time series refer to the summer and winter breaks. Overall, it is reassuring to see no extreme changes in average school absences across our sample period. Note that drastic jumps in the number of absent students often coincide with weather events. For instance, the significant increase in 2014 refers to the 2014 nor’easter and in 2012 to intense snowfall.\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Create the data for the plot\nplot = absent |>  filter(DayType == \"NormalDay\") |> filter(absent < quantile(absent, 0.99, na.rm = T)) |> group_by(date, year) |>  summarise(absent = mean(absent)) |> ungroup() |> \n  mutate(RollMean = rollmean(absent, k = 5, fill = NA))\n\n# Plot it\nggplot(plot) + \n  geom_bar(aes(x = date, y = absent, fill = as_factor(year)), size = 0.05, stat = \"identity\") + \n  labs(y = \"Mean Absences\", x = \"Date\") + guides(fill = \"none\") + theme_economist() %+replace%\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), plot.background = element_blank()) +\n  grids(\"y\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Time Series of Daily School Absences\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 8, we portray the average value of school absences across months of the year. The first thing to notice is a significant increase in absences for the month before the summer holidays. Additionally, absences appear to be higher during the winter months of December to February because of weather conditions and seasonal influenza. Regarding variation within weeks (?@fig-WeeklyTS). There are more increased absences on Fridays and Mondays and lower throughout the rest of the week.\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Construct the data for the plot \nplot = list(`Monthly Variation` = absent |>  dplyr::filter(DayType == \"NormalDay\") |> \n           filter(absent < quantile(absent, 0.99, na.rm = T)) |> \n           mutate(month = month(date, label = T)) |> \n           group_by(ts = month) |>  summarise(absent = mean(absent, na.rm = T)) ,\n           \n           `Weekday Variation` = absent |>  dplyr::filter(DayType == \"NormalDay\") |> \n           filter(absent < quantile(absent, 0.99, na.rm = T)) |> \n           mutate(weekday = substr(weekday, 1,2)) |> \n           group_by(ts = weekday) |>  summarise(absent = mean(absent, na.rm = T))) %>% \n  \n  rbindlist(., idcol = \"window\")\n           \n           \n        \n# Plot the time series\nggplot(plot) + geom_bar(aes(x = ts, y = absent, group = 1), stat = \"identity\", fill = \"#141f52\") + \n  geom_point(aes(x = ts, y = absent, group = 1), color = \"red\") +\n  labs(y = \"Mean Absences\", x = \"\") + guides(fill = \"none\") + theme_economist() %+replace%\n  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), plot.background = element_blank()) +\n  grids(\"y\") + facet_wrap(~window, scales = \"free\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Monthly Variation in School Absences\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the study, we aggregate the school-level data into neighborhood averages for three main reasons. First, aggregating data reduces the noise from school-specific miss-recordings and human error. Second, it is easier to match socio-demographic data from the American Community Survey. And third, it decreases the computational burden of our empirical strategy.\nTable 2 contains descriptive statistics on school absences at the neighborhood level. The NTA data contains 379,120 observations across 0 neighbourhoods. On average, there are 491 absences per day, equivalent to around 8.90% of enrolled students. The absences have a median of 354 and a standard deviation of 573.

Predicted values are significantly higher during the summer months of June to August and the Winter Months of December to January. While higher summer values are in line with higher ozone formation during the hotter months of the year because of the interaction of solar radiation with ozone precursors, higher winter measures relate to the lower efficiency of internal combustion engines at cold temperatures and the use of fossil fuels for residential heating. Even though the AQI value seems higher between 2008 and 2011 and lower after that, it is not straightforward to notice any long-term trend. Regarding weekday variation, there are slightly higher average values at the start of the week (Monday to Wednesday) and lower from Thursday to Sunday.\n\n\nShow the Code\n#\n# Construct the data for the plot \nplot = list(Yearly = filter(aqif, date < \"2018-12-31\") |>  \n  mutate(year = substr(year(date),3,4)) |> \n  group_by(frame = year) %>% summarise(aqi = mean(aqi, na.rm = T)), \n  \n  Monthly = filter(aqif, date < \"2018-12-31\") |>  \n  mutate(month = month(date, label = T)) |> \n  group_by(frame = month) %>% summarise(aqi = mean(aqi, na.rm = T)), \n  \n  Weekly = filter(aqif, date < \"2018-12-31\") |>  \n  mutate(weekday = weekdays(date, abbreviate = T)) |> \n  group_by(frame = weekday) %>% summarise(aqi = mean(aqi, na.rm = T))) %>% \n  \n  rbindlist(., idcol = \"window\")\n\n# Compute the deviation from the mean\nplot = plot |>  group_by(window) |> \n  mutate(change = ((aqi -mean(aqi))/mean(aqi))*100)\n\n# Plot the time series \nggplot(plot) + \n  geom_bar(aes(y = aqi, x = frame, group = 1), fill = \"#141f52\", stat = \"identity\") + \n  geom_point(aes(y = aqi, x = frame, group = 1), color = \"red\") + \n  \n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Air Quality Index\") + facet_wrap(~window, scales = \"free\") +\n  \n  theme_economist()%+replace% \n  theme(legend.title = element_blank(), plot.background = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(vjust = 2, angle = 90), \n        strip.text = element_text(hjust = 0)) + grids(\"y\") \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Mean monthly value of the AQI forecast\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14 contains the density function of the AQI forecast. The forecasts appear normally distributed between zero and slightly before one hundred units. However, as we approach one hundred units, there is some clear bunching around the alert threshold, suggesting that the model used by the NYSDEC may work slightly differently when the forecast is in the neighborhood of the alert.

    "text": "Regression Discontinuity\nFirst, I infer causality with a regression discontinuity design (RD). The RD exploits the quasi-random allocation of air quality alerts around the emission threshold to infer causality. The central assumption is that days with forecasted AQI values very close to the alert at either side of the emission threshold only differ because of the alert and not because of concomitant factors like weather or air pollution. Under this assumption, the difference in the expected value of school absences on days just below and above the emission threshold is the local average treatment effect on the treated around the discontinuity.\nThe following panel shows the data-driven sharp discontinuity RD plot of school absences as a function of the AQI. The left panel contains a natural linear fit to the left and right sides of the discontinuity. In contrast, the right panel adjusts the polynomial fit with weekday, school year, month, and school period fixed effects alongside weather covariates in the form of average, minimum, and maximum temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and relative humidity. The graphical representation of the discontinuity suggests a jump in school absences after the alert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscontinuity in school absences around the alert threshold\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscontinuity in school absences around the alert threshold (Covariate Adjusted)\n\n\n\n\n\nA central assumption of the RD is that no discontinuous unobservables affect both the score and dependant variables. Unfortunately, in the case of air quality alerts in New York, this is not the case. For instance, if both the likelihood of an alert and school absences are consistently higher on Mondays, we may capture the Monday instead of the alert’s effect. To control for the discontinuous impact of this kind of temporal covariates, I run three additional specifications to the raw RD. The first one adds weekday, month, school year, school period, and holiday fixed effects, while the second one further includes average, minimum, and maximum temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and relative humidity as weather covariates. Equation RD specifies the functional form of the preferred model.\n\\[\nAbsent_{nt}  =  \\beta D_{t}(AQI_{t} \\geq 101) + \\tilde{\\mu}^- f(AQI_t)+ \\tilde{\\mu}^+ f(AQI{_t}\\times D_{nt}) +  W'_{nt} \\Delta + \\Omega_{t} + \\epsilon_{t}\n\\] In it, \\(Absent_{nt}\\) is the log of absent students at neighborhood \\(n\\) on day \\(t\\), \\(AQI_{t}\\) is the AQI forecast at time \\(t\\), and \\(D_{t}\\) the treatment indicator equal to one when the AQI is higher than one hundred units. \\(f(AQI_{t}\\times D_{nt})\\) is a linear fit before (\\(\\tilde{\\mu}_{-}\\)) and after (\\(\\tilde{\\mu}_{+}\\)) the discontinuity; I use a linear fit because it performs better and has more accurate boundary properties than higher-order polynomials . \\(W'_{nt}\\) and \\(\\Omega_{t}\\) are matrices of weather controls and time fixed-effects. The estimate of interest, \\(\\beta\\), captures the of the alert on school absences around the emission threshold. finally, the bandwidth around the discontinuity comes from the data-driven plug-in rules based on mean squared error expansions proposed by .\nThe RD strategy is suitable to assess the effect of the alert as parents, schools, or neighborhoods cannot manipulate the AQI or the emission of the alert. Furthermore, there is perfect compliance between the alert’s emission and the running variable as every time the AQI forecast surpasses one hundred units, the probability of the alert jumps from zero to one. Still, there remains the possibility that New Yorkers conditional expectation of an alert would rely on the raw AQI independent of the forecast. Thus, similar to , I provide robust estimates for a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, which exploits the discontinuity in the probability of assignment to treatment to infer causality.\nBesides the fuzzy RD, I perform three robustness exercises in case the fixed effects are not flexible enough to reduce the bias from correlated temporal covariates. First, I run the RD for a matched data set of treatment and control units. I match both groups with propensity score matching based on weather covariates, the weekday, and the month of the observation. Second, I estimate a two-stage RD with the residuals of a Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator panel model of school absences as a function of selected weather covariates and fixed effects. Third, I estimate a two-stage least-squares (2sls) Poisson MLE with the difference between the actual and forecasted AQI in linear and quadratic form as instruments for the alert"

I account for the biasing effects of weather covariates by explicitly controlling for temperature and precipitation.

Next, I consider the effect of pollution exposure on school absences by accounting for the actual value of the air quality index at \\(t\\) (\\(AQI_t\\)). I incorporate seasonality into the empirical model through time-dependent fixed effects (\\(\\Omega_t\\)). Specifically, I include year, month, and weekday fixed effects alongside an indicator variable of day types controlling for exogenous weather or administrative shocks to school absences. Finally \\(\\lambda_i\\) are neighborhood fixed effects and \\(epsilon_{it}\\) the error term clustered at the neighborhood-by-week level to account for the possibility of inter-temporal correlation within neighborhoods and school weeks.\nTable 1 contains the results of estimating the Equation 1 in levels across three different specifications. (1) controls for weather and air pollution at \\(t\\) alongside neighborhood fixed effects and an indicator variable for day-types controlling for unobservable shocks to school absences like hurricanes or general examinations. (2) further includes weekday, month, and year fixed effects to account for seasonality. Finally, (3) is a more restrictive design capturing the effect of the alerts on school absences from within neighborhood-month variation in absenteeism by adding the interaction of neighborhood, year, and month fixed effects. Furthermore (3) also assumes different weekday patterns across neighborhood by including neighborhood-by-weekday fixed effects.\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Set the path of the R-studio project\nfile = gsub(\"website\", \"\", getwd())\n\n# Load the results\ntab = list(`OLS` = read_rds(paste0(file, \"/02_GenData/06_RegResults/01_rdd/MainOls.rds\")),\n           `OLS (Log)` = read_rds(paste0(file, \"/02_GenData/06_RegResults/01_rdd/LogOls.rds\")))\n\n# bind the list elements \ntab = reduce(tab,cbind)\n\n# Add the commas to numeric elements\ntab[\"N.obs\",] = comma(as.numeric(tab[\"N.obs\",]))\ntab[\"BIC\",] = comma(as.numeric(tab[\"BIC\",]))\n\n# Make the table\nkbl(tab, align = \"lcccccc\", digits = 2, booktabs = T) %>%\n  kable_classic_2(bootstrap_option = c(\"hover\"), full_width = F) %>% \n  pack_rows(\"Fitted-Statistics\", 3, 5) %>%\n  add_header_above(c(\" \" = 1, \"OLS\" = 3, \"OLS (Log)\" = 3))\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Effect of the alert on school absences (OLS) \n \n\n\nOLS\nOLS (Log)\n\n  \n      \n    1 \n    2 \n    3 \n    1 \n    2 \n    3 \n  \n \n\n  \n    Estimate \n    112.90 *** \n    64.94 *** \n    62.93 *** \n    19.57 *** \n    9.63 *** \n    9.41 *** \n  \n  \n     \n    (9.39) \n    (8.54) \n    (7.50) \n    (1.16) \n    (0.99) \n    (0.87) \n  \n  Fitted-Statistics\n\n    N.obs \n    355,144 \n    355,144 \n    355,144 \n    355,144 \n    355,144 \n    355,144 \n  \n  \n    R2 \n    0.64 \n    0.68 \n    0.73 \n    0.83 \n    0.86 \n    0.89 \n  \n  \n    BIC \n    4,946 \n    4,908 \n    5,107 \n    337 \n    265 \n    426 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: Effects of air quality health advisories on school absences in New York City. Point estimates come from an OLS and Log-OLS estimator of daily school absences per neighborhood as a function of an indicator variable equal to one in days with air quality health advisories. We present results across three specifications. (1) controls for the realized air quality index at \\(t\\), quintile indicator variables of temperature and precipitation, neighborhood fixed effects, and indicators of abnormal events. (2) adds weekday, month, and year fixed-effects to account for seasonality. (3) is a more restrictive design assuming neighborhood-specific seasonal trends with year-by-month-by-nta and weekday-by-nta fixed effects. Interpret the OLS estimates as the effect in absences because of the advisory and the Log-OLS coefficients as the percentage increase in absences (\\(\\beta\\) = (exp()-1)). Standard errors clustered at the neighborhood-by-week level to account for possible inter-temporal correlations within cities and weeks of the year. Significance Codes: : 0.01, : 0.05, : 0.1\n\nAcross all specifications, the OLS results suggest that AQAs increase school absences by 112.9 in the most parsimonious model and 62.9 in the full model with high-dimensional fixed effects. According to the Bayes Information Criteria (BIC), the second column without high-dimensional fixed effects is the prefered specification. It implies 64.9 additional missing students per NYC neighborhood on days with AQAs. The OLS-Log model provides elasticities by estimating the effect on the log of school absences as dependent variable. Results imply that the raise in school absences translates to percentage increase between 9.41% and 19.57%.\nWe perform different robustness exercises to check the stability of point estimates. Figure 1 shows the effect of changing the specification of weather controls across six different models. 2) Is the preferred specification with quintile indicator variables of rain and temperature. 1) excludes all weather controls from the estimation. 3)Changes the quintile indicator variables to decile indicator variables. 4) Only controls linearly for temperature and precipitation. 5) adds to d a linear specification of relative humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. And f) includes the quintile indicator variables of temperature and precipitation alongside linear controls for relative humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Effect of the alert on school absences (Log Model)\n\n\n\n\nThe effect of the AQAs on school absences remains positive and significant across specifications. The estimates go from 5.68% to 13.83% in the fourth and third specifications. On the one hand, using decile indicators (3rd design) may decrease point estimates by significantly reducing the available variance we need to identify the effect. On the other, controlling linearly for temperature and precipitation (4th design) may not account for nonlinearities in the weather-absences relationship.\nFigure 2 shows effect of controlling for students’ exposure to the realized AQI in different ways. 1) excludes the AQI from the preferred specification. 2) controls linearly for the AQI and is our prefered specification. 3) includes a quadratic representation of the AQI. 4) controls for exposure with k-1 quintile indicator variables of the AQI. And 5) changes the quintile for decile indicator variables of exposure. Across all specifications, there are no significant changes in the effect of AQAs on school absences.\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Set the path of the R-studio project\nfile = gsub(\"website\", \"\", getwd())\n\n# Load the data\ndata = read_rds(paste0(file, \"/02_GenData/06_RegResults/01_rdd/OlsRobustAqi.rds\"))\n\n# Add the specification \ndata = mutate(data, notes = c(\"No Air quality index\", \"Linear AQI\", \n                              \"Quadratic AQI\", \"Quintile AQI\", \"Decile AQI\"))\n# Add the confidence intervals\ndata = mutate(data, up = estimate + std.error*1.64, \n              down = estimate - std.error*1.645, \n              ci = paste0(round(estimate,2), \" (\", round(up, 2),\"-\", round(down, 2), \")\"))\n\n# Add the limits of the plot\nmax = filter(data, up == max(up))$up; min = 0\nmaxy = length(unique(data$spec)) + 1\n\ndata = mutate(data, spec = as.character(spec))\n# Plot the estimates\nggplot(data) + \n  geom_errorbar(aes(y = spec, xmax = up, xmin = down),width = 0.25)  + \n  geom_point(aes(x = estimate, y = spec)) + \n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 0), color = \"red\") +\n  \n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\") + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, max), ylim = c(1, 5), clip = \"off\")  + \n  \n  annotate(\"text\", label = \"Estimate (90% CI)\", x = 19, y = maxy) +\n  annotate(\"text\", label = data$ci, x = 19, y = data$spec, size = 3) +\n  \n  annotate(\"text\", label = \"FEs Specification\" , x = -10, y = maxy) +\n  annotate(\"text\", label = str_wrap(data$notes, 20) , x = -10, y = data$spec, size = 3) +\n  \n  annotate(\"text\", label = \"N.Obs\" , x = -5, y = maxy) +\n  annotate(\"text\", label = comma(data$n) , x = -5, y = data$spec, size = 3) +\n  \n  annotate(\"text\", label = \"R.Squared\" , x = 23, y = maxy) +\n  annotate(\"text\", label = round(data$r2, 2) , x = 23, y = data$spec, size = 3) +\n\n  \n  theme_economist() %+replace% \n  theme(plot.margin = margin(1, 7, 1, 8, unit = \"cm\"), plot.background = element_blank()) +\n  grids(\"y\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Effect of the alert on school absences (AQI Robustness)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 contains the confidence intervals of four different clustering specifications. 1) is the preferred specification with standard errors clustered at the nta-by-week level, 2) clusters at the nta-by-month, 3) at the nta-by-yer, and 4) at the neighborhood levels.

For instance, are the alert’s effect on school absences different across city boroughs, races, or social classes? And if so, what are the likely mechanisms behind this heterogeneity? Figure 4 estimates the difference in the effect of AQAs concerning The Bronx. Results show that AQAs increase school absences by 6.3% fewer kids in Staten Island. The estimate decreases for Queens and Brookyn and becomes indeistingishable from zero for Manhattan.\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Set the path of the R-studio project\nfile = gsub(\"website\", \"\", getwd())\n\n# Load the data\ndata = read_rds(paste0(file, \"/02_GenData/06_RegResults/01_rdd/BoroOls.rds\"))\n\n# Compute the change w.r.t.

For this, I divide the sample by income quintiles and estimate the effect of the AQAs concerning the lowest quintile. Air quality alerts increase school absences the most for persons living in the less wealthy neighborhoods of the city. On days with air quality alerts, school absences in poor neighborhoods increase by 83.37%. This estimate decreases by 20.5% when looking at the second quintile and by more than 50% in Q3, Q4, and Q5.\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Set the path of the R-studio project\nfile = gsub(\"website\", \"\", getwd())\n\n# Load the data\ndata = read_rds(paste0(file, \"/02_GenData/06_RegResults/01_rdd/IncomeOls.rds\"))\n\n# Compute the change w.r.t. to Q1 ####\ndata = mutate(data, ref = filter(data, term == \"treated\")$estimate)\ndata = filter(data, term != \"treated\")\n\n# Add the confidence intervals\ndata = mutate(data, up = estimate + std.error*1.64, \n              down = estimate - std.error*1.645, \n              ci = paste0(round(estimate,2), \" (\", round(up, 2),\"-\", round(down, 2), \")\"))\ndata = mutate(data, quintile = paste0(\"Q\", quintile))\n\n# Add the limits of the plot\nmax = filter(data, up == max(up))$up\nmin = filter(data, down == min(down))$down\nmaxy = length(unique(data$quintile)) +1\n\n# Plot the estimates\nggplot(data) +\n  \n  geom_point(aes(y = quintile, x = estimate)) + \n  \n  geom_errorbar(aes(y = quintile, \n                    xmin = estimate - std.error*1.645, \n                    xmax = estimate + std.error*1.645), width = 0.2) +\n  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(min, max), clip = \"off\") + labs(x = \"\", y = \"\") +\n  \n  annotate(\"text\", label = \"Estimate (90% CI)\", x = max - max , y = maxy) +\n  annotate(\"text\", label = data$ci, x = max - max, y = data$quintile, size = 3) +\n  \n  annotate(\"text\", label = str_wrap(paste(\"Reference Effect for Q1:\", round(data$ref,2)), 20), \n           x = min, y = 5, size = 4) +\n  \n  theme_economist() %+replace% \n  theme(plot.margin = margin(1, 5, 1, 0, unit = \"cm\"), plot.background = element_blank(), \n        axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0.05)) +\n  grids(\"y\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Effect of the alert on school absences across income quintiles (Log Model)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 shows the difference in point estimates across neighborhoods in different quintiles regarding the share asthma ER admissions. The idea is that city areas more sensitive to air pollution would try to adapt to the alert more than other regions. Interpret all estimates concerning the first quintile (neighborhoods with the lowest asthma E.R. admissions). Air quality alerts increase absences in the healthiest neighborhoods by 1.52%. Although this effect is not statistically different from zero at Q2, we do see a smaller impact when looking at Q3 and Q4. In line with more sensitive groups adapting to the alert, we do find that the impact is a whooping 58.3% higher in neighborhoods at the upper part of the E.R. admissions distribution.\n\n\nShow the Code\n# Set the path of the R-studio project\nfile = gsub(\"website\", \"\", getwd())\n# Load the data\ndata = read_rds(paste0(file, \"/02_GenData/06_RegResults/01_rdd/AsthmaErOls.rds\"))\n\n# Compute the change w.r.t. to Q3 ####\ndata = mutate(data, ref = filter(data, term == \"treated\")$estimate)\ndata = filter(data, term != \"treated\")\n\n# Add the confidence intervals\ndata = mutate(data, up = estimate + std.error*1.64, \n              down = estimate - std.error*1.645, \n              ci = paste0(round(estimate,2), \" (\", round(up, 2),\"-\", round(down, 2), \")\"))\n\n# Change the Quintile to a character vector\ndata = mutate(data, quintile = paste0(\"Q\", quintile))\n\n# Add the limits of the plot\nmax = filter(data, up == max(up))$up\nmin = filter(data, down == min(down))$down\nmaxy = length(unique(data$quintile)) +1\n\n# Plot the estimates\nggplot(data) +\n  \n  geom_point(aes(y = quintile, x = estimate)) + \n  \n  geom_errorbar(aes(y = quintile, \n                    xmin = estimate - std.error*1.645, \n                    xmax = estimate + std.error*1.645), width = 0.2) +\n  \n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 0), color = \"red\") +\n  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(min, max), clip = \"off\") + labs(x = \"\", y = \"\") +\n  \n  annotate(\"text\", label = \"Estimate (90% CI)\", x = max + max/3, y = maxy) +\n  annotate(\"text\", label = data$ci, x = max + max/3, y = data$quintile, size = 3) +\n  \n  annotate(\"text\", label = str_wrap(paste(\"Reference Effect for Q1:\", round(data$ref,2)), 20), \n           x = 0, y = 5, size = 4) +\n  \n  theme_economist() %+replace% \n  theme(plot.margin = margin(1, 5, 1, 0, unit = \"cm\"), plot.background = element_blank(), \n        axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0.05)) +\n  grids(\"y\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Effect of the alert on school absences across quintiles of asthma hospitalizations (Log Model)"
