# Introduction

This research report contains three primary sections to accompany my study on air quality alerts and school absences:

1. ***Data Sets*** Includes a description of all the data files I use throughout the study. It is divided into five sub-sections

::: {.incremental}
- Data on School Absences
- Data on the forecast of the air quality index
- Data on the air quality index
- Demographic covariates
- Weather data
:::

2. ***Descriptive Statistics*** contains descriptive statitistics on school absences in New york City. The forecast of the Air Quality Index the Department Of Environmental Conservation uses for emitting Air Quality Health Advisories. And the Environmental Protection Agency reports of the measured air quality index. I also divide this section in four sub-sections.


All the raw files needed to run the code are in the [dropbox repository](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1jyjs84sef7t1nt/AABtbantKPm4OyICNEIklpXLa?dl=0)

If you want to replicate the study:

Download all files in the [dropbox repository](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1jyjs84sef7t1nt/AABtbantKPm4OyICNEIklpXLa?dl=0) while considering the space constraints in your computer.[^1] The files in the repository have a folder-like structure with the following key sections:

[^1]: I recommend downloading the files to an external hard drive to avoid memory issues

1.  **01_RawData** -- Includes the raw data files obtained from the New York State Department of Education, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, The Environmental Protection Agency, and the Census Buro.

2.  **02_GenData** -- Contains the data files I use for the analysis.

3.  **03_scripts** -- Here, I include all the R-scripts I use to transform the raw data into a useful format, perform descriptive statistics, and run my empirical specifications

4.  **AQAs_School_Absences_NYC** -- This folder contains the Quarto files necessary to replicate this website

# Raw data files

As previously mentioned, the folder 01_RawData folder contains all the raw files I obtained to estimate the effect of air quality health advisories on school absences.

01_schools includes all files related to school absences and school characteristics in New York City. 02_AQI has the data on the air quality index forecast from the NYSDEC and the AQI measures from the EPA. 03_weather contains several data files of weather covariates. 04_shp is a repository of shape (or spatial) files. And 05_dem includes data on neighborhood-level socio-demographic characteristics from the US Census Buro.
